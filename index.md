## Overview

Surf Connect is a web application that address the problem where UH students from outside of Hawaii have trouble trying to surf. Surf Connect will make this easier for these students by recommending surf locations based on their surfing ability and location. Surf Connect will also connect students together with similar surfing ability and similar times they would like to surf. By doing this, Surf Connect addresses the overall issue by providing a location for students to surf, connect with others to have fun, and provide details on surf conditions to ensure saftey. Below are more specific goals Surf Connect must meet to be a successful application:

* Must provide the user with surf locations that match their surfing ability and location.
* The application must support multi-users that can login, logout and access their previous data.
* Must allow users to interact with each other through some kind of message system and like system.
* The surf reports for the surf locations must be updated everyday based on actual data.
* Must filter out users with similar surfing ability and similar times the users would like to surf.
